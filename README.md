#### Before you can use

This project is unstable state because of the rolling release **BoringSSL**, and modules.

#### Features

- Images are used Alpine Linux.
- NGINX built **BoringSSL** with SSE/SHA, and AVX2 SIMD-instructions.
- **TLSv1.3** patch: use of TLSv1.3 (DRAFT) is enforced NGINX-1.13+.
- PCRE with JIT enabled.
- HTTP/2.0 (+NPN) support.
- Async I/O using threads support.
- Dynamic TLS records patch CloudFlare support (and configured).
- Gzip static `.gz` files support enabled
- Brotli static `.br` files support (and configured).
  - Brotli on-the-fly disabled (dynamic compression unstable)

#### Notes

- Linux 3.17+, and the latest Docker stable are recommended.
- BoringSSL is naming ECDH curves differently, some modifications will be required if you want to use your own SSL/TLS config file.
  For example, `secp384r1` (OpenSSL, LibreSSL) is `P-384` (BoringSSL).
  BoringSSL does support multiple curves with its implementation of `SSL_CTX_set1_curves_list()`,
  an example is provided in the default `/etc/nginx/confssl_params`.
  `X25519` is actually the safest curve you can use so it should be the first curve in your list.
- BoringSSL can use cipher groups: a group is defined by brackets and ciphers are separated by `|` like this : `[cipher1|cipher2|cipher3]`.
  Ciphers in a group are considered equivalent on the server-side and let the client decide which cipher is the best.
  This can be useful when using ChaCha20, because AES remains faster than ChaCha20 on AES-NI devices.
